# MeyeDeep
A extremely basic and noob way to use deepstack object with motioneye recording

Since motioneye only uses motion for detection and creates false positives for me. I used DeepstackAI using python API to detect if a person in in frame at a set interval. When a person is detected, it sends the command to the motioneye server to start or stop recording.
